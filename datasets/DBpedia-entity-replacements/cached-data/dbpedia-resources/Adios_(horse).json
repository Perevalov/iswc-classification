His pacing record at the Shelbyville, Indiana fair stood for 43 years. Despite his racing success, he is most famous for his offspring. In 1948, Adios was bought by harness racing driver, Delvin Miller, to stand in stud at his Meadow Lands farm near Washington, Pennsylvania. The horse proved to be a tremendous stud, considered by many to be the greatest in harness racing history. He sired eight Little Brown Jug winners, more than any other horse, and his sons, Adios Butler and Bret Hanover both became winners of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Adios died on June 22, 1965. Before he died in 1965, Adios had sired 589 offspring. His name is synonymous with horse racing and can be found on consumer products and harness horse equipment. At his death, the horse was buried at Meadow Lands farm under his favorite apple tree near the paddock that had been his home for seventeen years. A race was named for him, held each year on the second Saturday in August at The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Meadow Lands, Pennsylvania. Since the first Delvin Miller Adios in 1967, it has evolved into one of the important events in the harness racing season. Adios Golf Club in Coconut Creek, Florida was named after the horse by his owner and club founder Delvin Miller. The course was designed in 1982 by fellow founder Arnold Palmer. In 1977, a book was published by Marie Hill titled Adios: the big daddy of harness racing. Two Gaits Farm in Carmel, Indiana, where Adios was foaled, was purchased in 2011 by Jeffrey and Beth Weisgerber. Adios Pass, a nearby street, is named after the sulky champion.",
