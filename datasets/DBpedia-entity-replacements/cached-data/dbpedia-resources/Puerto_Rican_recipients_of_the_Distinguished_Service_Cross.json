Many Puerto Ricans, including those of Puerto Rican descent, have distinguished themselves during combat as members of the five branches of the U.S. Military, the Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force and the Coast Guard. Nine Puerto Ricans have been awarded the United States' highest military decoration \u2014 the Medal of Honor, seven have been awarded the Navy Cross and eighteen have been awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) is the second highest military decoration of the United States Army, awarded for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force. Actions which merit the Distinguished Service Cross must be of such a high degree to be above those required for all other U.S. combat decorations but not meeting the criteria for the Medal of Honor. The following is a list of the fifteen Puerto Ricans awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with their citations. On March 18, 2014, President Barack Obama upgraded the Distinguished Service Cross' of Juan E. Negr\u00f3n, Demensio Rivera, Miguel Vera and F\u00e9lix M Conde Falc\u00f3n to the Medal of Honor in a ceremony held in the White House.",
