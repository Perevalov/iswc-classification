This was the last of the wartime riots in which blacks and their property were exclusively the victims. The city had become the destination for thousands of workers in the defense industry; from 1940 to 1943 the city had grown from 59,000 to 80,000 persons, with African Americans maintaining a proportion of roughly one third of the total. Workers were attracted to the buildup of high-paying jobs in the defense industry, concentrated at the shipyard, as Beaumont was located on the Neches River northeast of Houston on the Gulf Coast. A presidential Executive Order 8802 had prohibited racial and religious discrimination among defense contractors, and African Americans sought a share of opportunities in the high-paying jobs. New residents in Beaumont competed for jobs and housing in the crowded town, where whites had imposed segregated facilities, as was common across the South. There were also riots that summer in Detroit, Michigan; Mobile, Alabama; and Los Angeles, California; they were related to competition and tensions arising from the wartime build-up and migrations of workers to defense installations.",
