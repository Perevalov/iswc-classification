The difference between the two was defined by English class structure in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Players were deemed to be working-class wage-earners and the Gentlemen were members of the middle and upper classes, usually products of the English public school system. Whereas the Players were paid wages by their county clubs or fees by match organisers, the Gentlemen nominally claimed expenses. The whole subject of expenses was controversial and it was held that some leading amateurs were paid more for playing cricket than any professional. The inaugural fixture took place in 1806, with a return match the same year, but it was not continued in 1807 and, with cricket in decline during the Napoleonic Wars, it was not revived until 1819. Thereafter, it was played on a generally annual basis until 1962, with usually two or more games each season. It lacked repute in the middle years of the 19th century because the Gentlemen were often outclassed but then gained in prestige during the career of W. G. Grace as the matches became highly competitive. The advent of Test cricket coupled with social change in the 20th century saw its importance decline, especially in the aftermath of the Second World War. On 31 January 1963, the committee of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) agreed unanimously to abolish the concept of amateurism and all first-class cricketers became professional. The Gentlemen v Players fixture was by then viewed as an anachronism and was discontinued. A substitute fixture was sought but never instituted as the limited overs Gillette Cup competition began in 1963. A total of 274 Gentlemen v Players matches were played from 1806 to 1962. The Players won 125 and the Gentlemen 68. There were 80 draws and one tie.",
